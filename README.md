# h5pack
`h5pack` is a utility made to pack, analyze and unpack HDF5 audio datasets using data and annotations of various sources. HDF5 is an open-source file format for storing large, complex data. It uses a directory-like structure to organize data within the file. Click [here](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) to learn more about HDF5. Among other, HDF5 provides:

- Efficient storage: Handles large datasets with chunking and compression, reducing disk space usage.
- Fast I/O: Optimized for rapid reading/writing of multi-dimensional data, improving data loading speeds.
- Hierarhical structures: Organizes metadata, features, and audio data efficiently within a single file.
- Concurrent access: Supports concurrent access, enabling efficient multi-threaded data loading.
- Scalability: Handles massive datasets without performance degradation, making it ideal for large-scale machine learning tasks.
- Cross-platform: Works across different OS and programming languages, ensuring flexibility.

`h5pack` was made to go from raw files to HDF5 files and back in a robust, consistent and simple way. It provides a collection of tools to facilitate all the necessary tasks to make it possible:

- `h5pack pack`: Converts raw data and/or annotation files into an HDF5 file.
- `h5pack unpack`: Extracts raw data from an HDF5 file, allowing regeneration of the original input data.
- `h5pack virtual`: Creates a virtual dataset by combining multiple datasets into a single logical dataset without duplication, enabling seamless access to fragmented or distributed data.
- `h5pack info`: Displays the contents of an HDF5 file generated with `h5pack`, providing a quick overview of its structure.
- `h5pack checksum`: Verifies the integrity of an HDF5 file by checking its checksum to detect potential corruption.

# Installation
The following section shows different ways to install `h5pack`.

## Install through `pip` 
To install `h5pack`, run:
```bash
pip install h5pack
```

Verify the installation with:
```bash
h5pack --version
```

This should output:
```bash
h5pack version x.y.z yyyy-zzzz developed by Esteban G贸mez (Speech Interaction Technology, Aalto University)
```
Where:
- `x.y.z` represents the major, minor, and patch version
- `yyyy-zzzz` indicates the development start year and the current year

## Install through `uv`
Alternatively, you can install the tool using `uv`. This is adequate for when you can to keep it isolated from your python environment setup and just run it to analyze a certain data collection.

1. Install `uv` and `uvx` following the instructions for your operating system in [`uv` website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
2. Run:
```bash
uv tool install h5pack
```

3. Verify the installation with
```bash
uv tool run h5pack --version
```

or you can use the shortcut version `uvx`:

```bash
uvx h5pack --version
```

This should output:
```bash
h5pack version x.y.z yyyy-zzzz developed by Esteban G贸mez (Speech Interaction Technology, Aalto University)
```
Where:
- `x.y.z` represents the major, minor, and patch version
- `yyyy-zzzz` indicates the development start year and the current year


## Install in developer mode
Developer mode installation is intended for those developing new features for the tool. To set it up:
1. Clone the repository to your desired folder using:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```
2. Navigate to the root directory (where `pyproject.toml` is located):
```bash
cd <repository_folder>
```
3. Install in developer mode with:
```bash
python -m flit install -s
```
This will allow immediate reflection of any code modifications when the tool is executed in the terminal.

Before proceeding, ensure that Flit is installed. If not, install it with:
```bash
python -m pip install flit
```
For more information on `flit`, refer to the [Flit Command Line Interface documentation](https://flit.pypa.io/en/stable/).
